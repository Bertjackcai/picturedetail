分段是雅思的要求

#### 有效进行分段（把握数据类型切割）：

1. 数据差异（大中小+幅度）>标题>趋势>时间  
2. 篇幅+字数来把关！
3. <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bertjackcai/picturedetail/blob/main/img/image-20201022192457334.png" alt="image-20201022192648085" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### 执行

1. Brisbane一段，3个一段，Sydney和Darwin一段
2. 看差异
3. 这个不按趋势分（从篇幅角度写的太少）（4同1异）
4. 最后推荐大中小的分段
   1. 细节：Brisbane比较高，Darwin比较小，有一个微微的上升，Sydney却是微微下降
5. ![image-20201022193523401](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bertjackcai/picturedetail/img/img/image-20201022193532831.png)

## 历史加减法：

拿Gap year来举例：

看出题频率和旧题相关性：去看和往年的题多了什么，少了什么

![image-20201022194908725](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bertjackcai/picturedetail/img/img/image-20201022194244333.png)

1. discuss和outweigh的区别（但是其实一般都说）
2. 11/7号最主要的区别：for their studies(和2/28的主要区别)
   1. 上面的题更开放
   2. 11/7需要往学习上靠

#### 比如 online  education：

1. 人群在变动：
   1. 09： students---11    university students--- 12  children
   2. 需要考虑人群自带的特征：BUFF
   3. 对于大学生：更加自主
   4. 对于Children: self-control,专注度等，教学参与度

#### 10-10号的题：（之前也有，可以对比）

1. Today, many tasks at home or work have been done by robots. Is this a positive or negative development?（2020/10/10)

2. Some people think that robots are very important for humans' future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

3. 第一题限制：task at home or work

4. 考点就是对比的问题：**多读题**

5. 结构总结：

   1. 从结构来说，可以采取五段式的写法：
      　　第一段：话题背景+个人观点(积极发展)
         　　第二段：(积极)论述分论点1：机器人在工作方面高效的好处。
         　　第三段：(积极)论述分论点2：机器人在人们生活方面的好处。
         　　第四段：(消极)论述机器人广泛使用也会产生问题。
         　　第五段：总结段，总结个人观点。

6. 自己怎么找论据？：（不会翻墙就用必应国际版）

   ![image-20201022200805723](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bertjackcai/picturedetail/img/img/image-20201022194318749.png)

#### 11年范文：

Some people think that robots are very important for humans' future development.
Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative
effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

The present century has witnessed the use of robots in almost all domains of
business. Some people think robotics will be instrumental in improving the quality
and lowering the cost of products in the future, while others opine this will lead
to job losses and machines’ dominance over humans. I believe a judicious use of
robots in a regulated atmosphere will be beneficial to the humanity.

Robots will perform an important role in various industries such as automobiles,
nuclear power, waste disposal, and construction. Companies such as Tesla and
Toyota have already automated manufacturing of cars and this has reduced the
overall cost of the car. The use of robots, which can work efficiently at high speed,
will continue to reduce costs in the future as well. Moreover, this will
reduce the chances of a human error which often leads to product quality
issues. For instance, Proctor and Gamble uses robots to standardize some
products and this has reduced customer complaints since the introduction of
automation.

Despite these benefits, the use of robotics will lead to job losses. Numerous
studies have proved that the introduction of robots has reduced the number of
human workers in various plants. As companies such as Coca-Cola replace
humans with robots, the distribution of wealth will get more skewed and this will
reduce social stability and harmony. Moreover, some people fear the dominance
of machines over humans. Corporations such as Google and Facebook use
robots control the Internet as well as user information. This may lead to a
situation when the robots will know more about human behavior than humans
themselves and they may control the human mind.

In conclusion, though the use of robots may have adverse consequences on the
development of civilization, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.
Governments and corporations should use robots judiciously only in areas in
which they are beneficial to the humans. Strict regulatory structures that prevent
the misuse of robots should be enforced.
